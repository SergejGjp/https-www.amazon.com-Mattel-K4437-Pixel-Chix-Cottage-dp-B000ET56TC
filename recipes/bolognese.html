        <p>A recipe for a bolognese. The ultimate comfort food.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package of spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 table spoons of olive oil</li>
            <li>3 slices of bacon</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 carrot, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>2 cans crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the spaghetti in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook the bacon in the oil until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir the onion, celery, carrot, and oregano into the bacon; continue cooking until the vegetables begin to soften, another 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Crumble the ground beef into the vegetable mixture; cook and stir until the beef is completely cooked and no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour the balsamic vinegar over the ground beef mixture; allow to simmer until the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar into the ground beef mixture; bring the mixture to a boil, season with salt and black pepper, and remove from heat. Stir the fresh basil into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Ladle the sauce over the cooked spaghetti. Top with Parmesan cheese to serve.</li>
        </ol>
